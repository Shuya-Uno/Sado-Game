      <p>Gradually, your moves become like as if you are break dancing!</p>
      <p>Your dance moves other's emotion...</p>
      <p>When you finally got too tired to stand and layed on the floor, you notice that you are recieving a large applause!</p>
      <p>You had realized the fun of entertaining people with your moves by this surprising experience, and you became a great break dancer!</p>
