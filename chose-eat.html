      <p>The sweets tasted really delicious!</p>
      <p>When you had finished eating, green tea in a
        nice looking tea bowl was carried in front of you.</p>
      <p>You see that other people are drinking the tea after turning their
         bowl twice on their palm, but you really like the beautiful painting on
         the bowl,
         and don't feel so much like turning the bowl.</p>
