      <p>You felt curious about how to use the stick, so you ate the sweets with your hands, and then started to think
         how the stick can be used.</p>
      <p>As you think, you came up of an image of an orchestra concert you had recently watched on TV, and imagined yourself being the conductor,
         and your stick being a taktstock.</p>
      <p>As you continue to imagine, you feel a brand new music of your own coming up to your mind!</p>
      <p>You conduct the orchestra in front of you, sometime gently, sometimes with great passion...
          Your band beautifully performs the music...</p>
      <p>After you have ended your performance, you hear a great applause...!</p>
      <p>After you have enjoyed the tea ceremony, you introduced the music that came up in your imagination,
         and the music became the greatest hit of the decade!</p>
      <p>You continued to introduce your music with your wonderful inspiration, and became a great composer!</p>
